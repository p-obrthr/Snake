## Snake
The well known classic Snake Game where you guide a snake to eat food and grow longer without colliding with walls or itself.
### Setup
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
After cloning the repo, install the necessary dependencies:

To compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript, use the following command:

```
Now you can simply open the `index.html` file in your browser and run the game.
